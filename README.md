This is my vim setup. There are many like it but thus one's mine. My vim setup is my best friend. It is my life. I must
master it as I must master my life. Without me, my vim setup is useless. Without my vim setup, I am useless. I must edit
faster than my enemy who is trying to edit me. I must edit his files before he edits mine. I will! My vim setup and
myself are defenders of my codebase. We are the masters of our enemey. We are the survivors of my life.
