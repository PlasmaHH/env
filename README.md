This is my development environment. There are many like it but thus one's mine. My development environment is my best friend. It is my life. I must
master it as I must master my life. Without me, my development environment is useless. Without my development environment, I am useless. I must edit
faster than my enemy who is trying to edit me. I must edit his files before he edits mine. I will! My development environment and
myself are defenders of my codebase. We are the masters of our enemey. We are the survivors of my life.
